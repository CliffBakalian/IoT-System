# MIDI-LIGHTS

I found a Evolution MK-225C MIDI keyboard laying around my house that no one was using so 
I decided that I wanted to use it to trigger events.  

What type of events you say?  
Well who knows, but I think I want to control my lights, or at least my table lights with it.

Right now I am using my compuer but I think it would be fun to hook this up to an arduino board. 
Then hook my lights up the board. I would be using an arduino uno board.   

I am using Python 3.
