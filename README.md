# MIDI-LIGHTS

I found a Evolution MK-225C MIDI keyboard laying around my house that no one was using so 
I decided that I wanted to use it to trigger events.  

I also roumaged around and found an old erector set motor and parts. I ordered 
some cuttable addressable rgb lights as well. Im thinking: 

+ ~~make bar~~
+ attach lights to bar
+ attach bar to motor like a propeller blade
+ ~~hook motor and control up to aruino board~~
+ hook up lights to arduino board
+ ~~hook up midi keyboard to arudino board~~
+ ~~get input from midi keyboard~~
+ sync lights up to rotation speed of motor to get those picture effects
+ map certain melodis/midi keys to differnt pictures/colors
+ done
