# IoT Controller and Server + Peripherals

I found a Evolution MK-225C MIDI keyboard laying around my house that no one was using so 
I decided that I wanted to use it to trigger events.  

Thanks to [https://github.com/jugoodma/818bw-project](https://github.com/jugoodma/818bw-project), I have some ESP8266 boards, some robots, and a whole bunch of arduino boards. 

I also have some lights, motors and speakers and a raspberry Pi.

The plan is to have a closed system of IoT devices, where the server is on a raspberry Pi with the MIDI Keybaord as the controller.

Peripherial Items:
 + Robotic Cars
 + Addressable RGB Light strips
 + Speaker
 + robotic arm kit
